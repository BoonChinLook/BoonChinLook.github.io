<!--New Years resolutions-->
### New Years Resolutions:

New Year's Resolutions: For my New Year's resolutions, I aim to step outside of my comfort zone.

This year, I started running 5 kilometers each week as a New Year's resolution. While I am generally an active person, I rarely engage in cardiovascular exercises beneficial for heart health, preferring weightlifting and non-cardio-intensive exercises. This year, I intend to change that.

Furthermore, I am making an effort to broaden my horizons and engage with my local community. For example, I recently participated in the HSE "Healthy Food made Easy" programme, which consisted of cooking classes for 2.5 hours a week over six weeks.

Additionally, as a follow on completion of the Healthy Food made easy programme, I hope to challenge myself by cooking all my college meals myself, as generally I would buy lunch outside.

### Skills

💻 Programming Languages:

Tech Stack:  Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GitHub and SQL. 

Computer software:  Microsoft Office, Git, Alteryx, Tableau, Power BI.
