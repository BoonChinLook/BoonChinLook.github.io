::: {style="text-align: justify;"}
Throughout my time at university, I’ve actively sought opportunities to grow both personally and professionally through diverse experiences in work, volunteering, and sport.

As a Business with Data Analytics student at DCU, I’ve taken on leadership roles such as Class Representative and DCU Mentor, while also being a mentee myself. I love supporting my peers and fostering a strong sense of community. I’m always open to opportunities that involve learning, growing, and helping others.

My commitment to giving back is evident in my support for colleagues when needed, and through initiatives like Ballymunch, where I help adults learn to cook. I also completed the Healthy Food Made Easy programme, an initiative led by the Health Service Executive (HSE) in my local community.

Driven by a passion for continuous learning, I participated in Dell Technologies’ STEM Aspire and Innovative Communities mentorship, while my job has helped me develop strong time management skills by balancing work with academic and extracurricular commitments. Outside of academics, I challenge myself every year by joining clubs outside my comfort zone, from rock climbing and art to table tennis. Most recently, I completed the 11km Runamuck obstacle course. These experiences have shaped me into a well-rounded, motivated individual with a strong work ethic and a drive to make a positive impact.

          <p>Since then, I’ve committed to regular running and gym workouts to improve my endurance. This year, I’m taking on the 13km Hell & Back obstacle course, better prepared and encouraging more colleagues to take on the challenge with me.</p>

          </div>
          <p>One year, I challenged myself to learn baking and cooking, which inspired me to join the Ballymunch volunteering programme, supported by the Raising & Giving (RAG) Society.</p>
          <p>Through this experience, I developed valuable skills and later joined the HSE’s Healthy Food Made Easy programme, a six-week initiative with weekly four-hour sessions. I was part of a class of about 11 people from my local community, where we cooked nutritious meals together and built a supportive environment based on shared learning.</p>

        <p>I am an active member of the DCU Rock Climbing Club. Bouldering, climbing up to 2 meters high and descending safely, helps me step out of my comfort zone and meet like-minded individuals within a sport.</p>
        <p>Additionally, in 2024, as part of DCU rock climbing, I competed in the intervarsities and placed 3rd in the beginner female category.</p>
