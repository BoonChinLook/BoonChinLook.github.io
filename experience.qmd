Throughout my time at university, I’ve actively sought out opportunities to grow both personally and professionally through diverse experiences in work, volunteering, and sport. 

As a Business with Data Analytics student at DCU, I’ve taken on leadership roles such as Class Representative and DCU Mentor while being a mentee myself. I have love supporting my peers and fostering a strong sense of community. I am up for anything that invovles learning, growing and helping others.

My commitment to giving back is evident in my helping collagues in need when they need it along with the Ballymunch initiative, where I help adults learn to cook. I also completed the Healthy Food Made Easy community cooking programme, a Heath Service Executive (HSE) led programme within my local community. 

My passion for continuous learning led me to participate in Dell Technologies’ STEM Aspire mentorship, while my job has helped me develop strong time management skills by balancing work with my academic and extracurricular commitments. Outside of academics, I challenge myself by joining clubs outside my comfort zone each year from rock climbing and art to table tennis and most recently completing the 11km Runamuck obstacle course. These experiences have shaped me into a well-rounded, motivated individual with a strong work ethic and a drive to make a positive impact.

          <p>Last year, I organised and took part in an 11km obstacle course run (Runamuck Challenge) with minimal training towards It, an experience which was both challenging and rewarding.</p>
          <p>Since then, I’ve committed to regular running and gym workouts to improve my endurance. This year, I’m taking on the 13km Hell & Back obstacle course, better prepared, and rallying colleagues to take on the challenge together.</p>

            <h3>Passion</h3>
          </div>
          <p>One year, I challenged myself to learn baking and cooking, which inspired me to participate in the Ballymunch volunteering programme, supported by the Raising And Giving (RAG) society.</p>
          <p> Through this experience, I gained valuable skills and, during my final semester in college, I decided to join the HSE's healthy eating programme, a six-week initiative that ran for four hours each week. I was part of a class of around 11 people from my local community, all learning to cook nutritious meals. Together, we created healthy dishes and fostered a supportive community built on collaboration and shared learning.</p>

        </div>
        <p>I am an active member of the DCU rock climbing club. I find it a fantastic way to go outside of my comfort zone. I mainly do bouldering which is climbing around up to 2 metres to then climb down safely if you can. It is a great way to meet new friendly people who have the same passion.</p>
        <p>Additionally, as part of DCU rock climbing, I competed in the intervertisites in 2024 and came in 3rd place of the beginners females.

        <p>Regular physical activity is essential for maintaining good health, and I believe visiting the gym at least twice a week is a great starting point. Personally, I prioritize going more frequently, as it not only helps me stay physically fit but also serves as an effective outlet for stress relief and mental clarity. For me, the gym is more than just a place to exercise, it's a space to focus on personal growth and well-being.</p>
