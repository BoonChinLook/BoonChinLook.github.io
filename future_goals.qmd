<div style="text-align: justify;">
With a foundation in Business with Data Analytics and a growing passion for technology, my future is shaped by both strategic intent and hands-on experience. From early exposure to roles in software development through mentorship with Innovative Communities, to gaining practical insights during the Dell Technologies STEM Aspire programme, I’ve developed a  vison of  building a career in the technology sectory.

Motivated by the rapidly evolving technological landscape, I had intentionally chosen Data Analytics as my university specialization within Business Studies, completing modules such as Programming & Visualization, Machine Learning & Advanced Python, Workflow & Data Management, Econometrics, and Forecasting. Moreover, outside of university, I completed courses in software development. These experiences have strengthened my technical foundation and reaffirmed my ambition to pursue a career as a software developer.

My professional growth is also reflected in my academic projects, developing a Quarto-based ePortfolio hosted on GitHub Pages (this website). This not only sharpened my web development and version control skills but also allowed me to showcase my journey and capabilities in a structured, industry-relevant format.

Looking ahead, I plan to develop more code-based projects and persue courses around the technology space as part of continuing professional development (CPD), bridging the gap between my business acumen and technical skill set

Ultimately, I am driven by a commitment to continuous learning, adaptability, and a passion for solving complex problems. My goal is to thrive in a dynamic tech environment where I can contribute meaningfully and continously learn.
