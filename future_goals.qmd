With a foundation in Business with Data Analytics and a growing passion for technology, my future is shaped by both strategic intent and hands-on experience. From early exposure to software development through mentorship with Innovative Communities, to gaining practical insights during the Dell Technologies STEM Aspire programme, I’ve developed a clear vision for building a career in the tech sector.

Motivated by the rapidly evolving technological landscape, I intentionally chose Data Analytics as my specialization within Business Studies, completing modules such as Programming & Visualization, Machine Learning & Advanced Python, Workflow & Data Management, Econometrics, and Forecasting. Beyond university, I’ve also completed external courses in software development, which have further strengthened my technical foundation and reaffirmed my ambition to become a software developer.

My professional growth is also reflected in my academic projects, most notably, the development of a Quarto-based ePortfolio hosted on GitHub Pages (this website). This project sharpened my skills in web development and version control while providing a structured and industry-relevant way to showcase my journey and capabilities. It gave me valuable insight into my progress; where I started, where I am now, and where I aspire to be in the future.

Looking ahead, I plan to develop more code-based projects and pursue courses across the tech space as part of my continuing professional development (CPD), further bridging the gap between my business acumen and technical skill set.

Ultimately, I am driven by a commitment to continuous learning, adaptability, and a passion for solving complex problems. My goal is to thrive in a dynamic tech environment where I can contribute meaningfully to a company and continue to grow both personally and professionally.
