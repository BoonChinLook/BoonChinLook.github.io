As part of the Business and Professional Ethics module, we were given a pair assignment. This task challenged us to reflect deeply on ethical theories covered in class, including those of Aristotle, Kant, and Bentham. Our objective was to design a unique ethical framework that answers the fundamental question: "Why do we act?"

Through collaborative dialogue and thoughtful exchange of ideas, my partner and I explored philosophical principles to craft a coherent and creative ethical theory. This process involved naming our theory, defining its core inspiration, critically comparing it with existing theories, and demonstrating its application in a real-world scenario. Deep thinking, creativity, and teamwork were key elements of this assignment, culminating in the development of our theory: Unified Fulfillment Theory (UFT).
