As part of a Business and Professional Ethics module, we were assigned a paired project that challenged us to reflect deeply on ethical theories discussed in class, including those of Aristotle, Kant, and Bentham. Our objective was to design a unique ethical framework that answers the fundamental question: “Why do we act?”

Through collaborative dialogue and thoughtful exchange of ideas, my partner and I explored philosophical principles to craft a coherent and creative ethical theory. This process involved naming our theory, defining its core inspiration, critically comparing it with existing frameworks, and demonstrating its application in a real-world scenario.

Deep thinking, creativity, and teamwork were central to this assignment, culminating in the development of our theory: the Unified Fulfillment Theory (UFT).
