    "text": "Throughout my time at university, I’ve actively sought out opportunities to grow both personally and professionally through diverse experiences in work, volunteering, and sport.\nAs a Business with Data Analytics student at DCU, I’ve taken on leadership roles such as Class Representative and DCU Mentor while being a mentee myself. I have love supporting my peers and fostering a strong sense of community. I am up for anything that invovles learning, growing and helping others.\nMy commitment to giving back is evident in my helping collagues in need when they need it along with the Ballymunch initiative, where I help adults learn to cook. I also completed the Healthy Food Made Easy community cooking programme, a Heath Service Executive (HSE) led programme within my local community.\nMy passion for continuous learning led me to participate in Dell Technologies’ STEM Aspire mentorship, while my job has helped me develop strong time management skills by balancing work with my academic and extracurricular commitments. Outside of academics, I challenge myself by joining clubs outside my comfort zone each year from rock climbing and art to table tennis and most recently completing the 11km Runamuck obstacle course. These experiences have shaped me into a well-rounded, motivated individual with a strong work ethic and a drive to make a positive impact.\n\n  My Interests\n  + \n\n\n  \n    \n        \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Running\n            Fitness\n          \n          Last year, I organised and took part in an 11km obstacle course run (Runamuck Challenge) with minimal training towards It, an experience which was both challenging and rewarding.\n          Since then, I’ve committed to regular running and gym workouts to improve my endurance. This year, I’m taking on the 13km Hell & Back obstacle course, better prepared, and rallying colleagues to take on the challenge together.\n          2024–Present, Dublin, Ireland\n        \n      \n    \n        \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Baking & Cooking\n            Passion\n          \n          One year, I challenged myself to learn baking and cooking, which inspired me to participate in the Ballymunch volunteering programme, supported by the Raising And Giving (RAG) society.\n           Through this experience, I gained valuable skills and, during my final semester in college, I decided to join the HSE's healthy eating programme, a six-week initiative that ran for four hours each week. I was part of a class of around 11 people from my local community, all learning to cook nutritious meals. Together, we created healthy dishes and fostered a supportive community built on collaboration and shared learning.\n          2023–Present, Dublin, Ireland\n        \n      \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Rock Climbing\n          Competitive Sport\n        \n        I am an active member of the DCU rock climbing club. I find it a fantastic way to go outside of my comfort zone. I mainly do bouldering which is climbing around up to 2 metres to then climb down safely if you can. It is a great way to meet new friendly people who have the same passion.\n        Additionally, as part of DCU rock climbing, I competed in the intervertisites in 2024 and came in 3rd place of the beginners females.\n        \n        2022-Present, Dublin, Ireland\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Gyming\n          Fitness\n        \n        Regular physical activity is essential for maintaining good health, and I believe visiting the gym at least twice a week is a great starting point. Personally, I prioritize going more frequently, as it not only helps me stay physically fit but also serves as an effective outlet for stress relief and mental clarity. For me, the gym is more than just a place to exercise, it's a space to focus on personal growth and well-being.\n        2022-Present, Dublin, Ireland\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  Work Experience\n  + \n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          The Baby Academy Ltd.,\n          Webinar Moderator\n        \n        Main tasks\n        \n  Prepared online classes, provided troubleshooting support, and assisted instructors to ensure smooth sessions.\n  Managed administrative tasks in Excel, including tracking class attendance.\n  Moderated online classes with up to 500 participants.\n\n\n        April 2024–Present, Dublin, Ireland\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          KPMG\n          Financial Services Tax Intern\n        \n        Main tasks\n        \n  Assisted team members and managers with client work, research, and organizational tasks.\n  Utilized Office 365 to manage data in Excel, schedule meetings in Outlook, and communicate with colleagues via email.\n\n\n        June 2023–July 2023, Dublin, Ireland\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Circle K\n          Customer Representative\n        \n        Main tasks\n        \n  Worked at the tills dealing with customers for fuel and items.\n  Cleaned fuel pumps and stocked the shop.\n\n\n        June 2021-January 2022, Dublin, Ireland\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  Local & Community Involvement\n  + \n\n\n  \n      \n        \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Ballymunch\n            Volunteering\n          \n          Participating in Ballymunch, a cooking class initiative for parents in Ballymun, has been an invaluable experience.

    "text": "With a foundation in Business with Data Analytics and a growing passion for technology, my future is shaped by both strategic intent and hands-on experience. From early exposure to roles in software development through mentorship with Innovative Communities, to gaining practical insights during the Dell Technologies STEM Aspire programme, I’ve developed a vison of building a career in the technology sectory.\nMotivated by the rapidly evolving technological landscape, I had intentionally chosen Data Analytics as my university specialization within Business Studies, completing modules such as Programming & Visualization, Machine Learning & Advanced Python, Workflow & Data Management, Econometrics, and Forecasting. Moreover, outside of university, I completed courses in software development. These experiences have strengthened my technical foundation and reaffirmed my ambition to pursue a career as a software developer.\nMy professional growth is also reflected in my academic projects, developing a Quarto-based ePortfolio hosted on GitHub Pages (this website). This not only sharpened my web development and version control skills but also allowed me to showcase my journey and capabilities in a structured, industry-relevant format.\nLooking ahead, I plan to develop more code-based projects and persue courses around the technology space as part of continuing professional development (CPD), bridging the gap between my business acumen and technical skill set\nUltimately, I am driven by a commitment to continuous learning, adaptability, and a passion for solving complex problems. My goal is to thrive in a dynamic tech environment where I can contribute meaningfully and continously learn.\n\nFind out more about my interests, community engagement and growths →\nExplore the short courses I’ve completed →\n\n\n Back to top"

    "title": "Creating an Ethical Theory",
    "section": "",
    "text": "As part of the Business and Professional Ethics module, we were given a pair assignment. This task challenged us to reflect deeply on ethical theories covered in class, including those of Aristotle, Kant, and Bentham. Our objective was to design a unique ethical framework that answers the fundamental question: “Why do we act?”\nThrough collaborative dialogue and thoughtful exchange of ideas, my partner and I explored philosophical principles to craft a coherent and creative ethical theory. This process involved naming our theory, defining its core inspiration, critically comparing it with existing theories, and demonstrating its application in a real-world scenario. Deep thinking, creativity, and teamwork were key elements of this assignment, culminating in the development of our theory: Unified Fulfillment Theory (UFT).\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "This project had critically explored the contrasting perspectives of the Stages of Growth (“modernization”) and Dependency schools of thought regarding economic development. It examined the historical, social, and political contexts that shaped each theory, highlighting how these foundations inform their differing understandings of development processes. The analysis also delves into their core arguments and policy recommendations, drawing attention to the unique implications of each perspective for global economic strategies.\n\n\n Back to top"
