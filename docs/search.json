It highlights the model’s focus on capital accumulation, labor, and technological progress as primary drivers of growth, while also addressing its shortcomings, such as the exogenous nature of technological progress and limited consideration of trade, inequality, and human capital. By integrating academic literature, this report offers a nuanced critique of the model’s theoretical foundations and its practical relevance in today’s economic context.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "This group project involved writing a report and producing a summary video presentation examining how Botswana successfully leveraged its mineral wealth, particularly diamonds, to transform from one of the world’s poorest nations into a stable, middle-income economy. The analysis highlights the government’s effective resource management, investments in social services, and infrastructure development.\nThe study also explored the risks of overreliance on diamonds and the growing impact of synthetic alternatives, emphasizing Botswana’s strategic shift toward economic diversification. Through initiatives like Vision 2036 and the Economic Reform and Transformation Plan, the country is promoting growth in tourism, agriculture, and manufacturing to build a more resilient and inclusive economy.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Throughout my time at university, I’ve actively sought opportunities to grow both personally and professionally through diverse experiences in work, volunteering, and sport.\nAs a Business with Data Analytics student at DCU, I’ve taken on leadership roles such as Class Representative and DCU Mentor, while also being a mentee myself. I love supporting my peers and fostering a strong sense of community. I’m always open to opportunities that involve learning, growing, and helping others.\nMy commitment to giving back is evident in my support for colleagues when needed, and through initiatives like Ballymunch, where I help adults learn to cook. I also completed the Healthy Food Made Easy programme, an initiative led by the Health Service Executive (HSE) in my local community.\nDriven by a passion for continuous learning, I participated in Dell Technologies’ STEM Aspire and Innovative Communities mentorship, while my job has helped me develop strong time management skills by balancing work with academic and extracurricular commitments. Outside of academics, I challenge myself every year by joining clubs outside my comfort zone, from rock climbing and art to table tennis. Most recently, I completed the 11km Runamuck obstacle course. These experiences have shaped me into a well-rounded, motivated individual with a strong work ethic and a drive to make a positive impact.\n\n\n  My Interests\n  + \n\n\n  \n    \n        \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Running\n            Fitness\n          \n          Last year, I organized and participated in a 11km obstacle course (Runamuck Challenge) with minimal training, an experience that was both challenging and rewarding.\n          Since then, I’ve committed to regular running and gym workouts to improve my endurance. This year, I’m taking on the 13km Hell & Back obstacle course—better prepared and encouraging more colleagues to take on the challenge with me.\n          2024–Present, Dublin, Ireland\n        \n      \n    \n        \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Baking & Cooking\n            Passion\n          \n          One year, I challenged myself to learn baking and cooking, which inspired me to join the Ballymunch volunteering programme, supported by the Raising and Giving (RAG) Society.\n          Through this experience, I developed valuable skills and later joined the HSE’s Healthy Food Made Easy programme, a six-week initiative with weekly four-hour sessions. I was part of a class of about 11 people from my local community, where we cooked nutritious meals together and built a supportive environment based on shared learning.\n          2023–Present, Dublin, Ireland\n        \n      \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Rock Climbing\n          Competitive Sport\n        \n        I am an active member of the DCU Rock Climbing Club. Bouldering, climbing up to 2 meters high and descending safely, helps me step out of my comfort zone and meet like-minded individuals within a sport.\n        Additionally, in 2024, as part of DCU rock climbing, I competed in the intervarsities and placed 3rd in the beginner female category.\n        2022-Present, Dublin, Ireland\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Gyming\n          Fitness & Well-being\n        \n        Regular physical activity is essential for maintaining both physical and mental health.

Throughout the course, I built a solid foundation in JavaScript fundamentals while working collaboratively on a group project. Key topics covered included:\n\nConditional logical and functions.\nArrays and loops.\nJavaScript for websites: Document Object Model manipulation (Parts 1 & 2).\nProject planning and presentation\n\nFor our final project, my partner and I created an interactive fruit shop basket, completed within a 2-week deadline.\nThe app offers a simple and engaging shopping experience. When a user enters the site, they are greeted by name and prompted to enter an item they’d like to purchase. If the item is unavailable, a friendly apology message is shown. The application also dynamically calculates the contents and total of the user’s basket, enhancing interactivity and usability.\nThis project strengthened my understanding of DOM manipulation, user interaction, and the value of clear project planning under time constraints. It was also a great opportunity to collaborate and apply theory to a fun, practical outcome.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "This project encompassed both collaborative and individual components. As a team, we developed a product concept and identified a dataset relevant to our idea. The task involved pitching our application, designed specifically for students, focusing on finance, innovation, and enterprise. Our pitch was presented as a video, which I’ve embedded on the first page of the PDF above containing my individual report.\nIndividually, we were responsible for diving deeper into the technical side of our pitch. This included conducting data analysis, identifying the market gap, understanding target customers, and outlining a strategic approach to product sales. While teamwork was encouraged, each member was expected to make a unique and meaningful contribution in their final report.\nBelow are key snippets of code I developed during the data analysis phase, which played a critical role in shaping our product’s direction. I led this part of the project, as it closely aligned with my strengths. I used a preliminary dataset to inform our pricing strategy and another to identify market gaps and opportunities. Snippets from the latter dataset are included below to illustrate how it supported our decision-making process.\n\n\nImporting Data and Intial Analysis\n\n\nImporting librarys\nimport

    "text": "With a foundation in Business with Data Analytics and a growing passion for technology, my future is shaped by both strategic intent and hands-on experience. From early exposure to software development through mentorship with Innovative Communities, to gaining practical insights during the Dell Technologies STEM Aspire programme, I’ve developed a clear vision for building a career in the tech sector.\nMotivated by the rapidly evolving technological landscape, I intentionally chose Data Analytics as my specialization within Business Studies, completing modules such as Programming & Visualization, Machine Learning & Advanced Python, Workflow & Data Management, Econometrics, and Forecasting. Beyond university, I’ve also completed external courses in software development, which have further strengthened my technical foundation and reaffirmed my ambition to become a software developer.\nMy professional growth is also reflected in my academic projects, most notably, the development of a Quarto-based ePortfolio hosted on GitHub Pages (this website). This project sharpened my skills in web development and version control while providing a structured and industry-relevant way to showcase my journey and capabilities.\nLooking ahead, I plan to develop more code-based projects and pursue courses across the tech space as part of my continuing professional development (CPD), further bridging the gap between my business acumen and technical skill set\nUltimately, I am driven by a commitment to continuous learning, adaptability, and a passion for solving complex problems. My goal is to thrive in a dynamic tech environment where I can contribute meaningfully to a company and continue to grow both personally and professionally.\n\nFind out more about my interests, community engagement and growth →\nExplore the short courses I’ve completed →\n\n\n Back to top"

    "section": "",
    "text": "As part of a Business and Professional Ethics module, we were assigned a paired project that challenged us to reflect deeply on ethical theories discussed in class, including those of Aristotle, Kant, and Bentham. Our objective was to design a unique ethical framework that answers the fundamental question: “Why do we act?”\nThrough collaborative dialogue and thoughtful exchange of ideas, my partner and I explored philosophical principles to craft a coherent and creative ethical theory. This process involved naming our theory, defining its core inspiration, critically comparing it with existing frameworks, and demonstrating its application in a real-world scenario.\nDeep thinking, creativity, and teamwork were central to this assignment, culminating in the development of our theory: the Unified Fulfillment Theory (UFT).\n\n\n\n Back to top"

It examined the historical, social, and political contexts that shaped each theory, highlighting how these foundations informed their differing interpretations of development processes. The analysis also delved into their core arguments and policy recommendations, drawing attention to the unique implications each perspective held for global economic strategy.\n\n\n\n Back to top"
