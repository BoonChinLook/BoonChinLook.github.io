While I am generally an active person, I rarely engage in cardiovascular exercises beneficial for heart health, preferring weightlifting and non-cardio-intensive exercises. This year, I intend to change that.\nFurthermore, I am making an effort to broaden my horizons and engage with my local community. For example, I recently participated in the HSE ‚ÄúHealthy Food made Easy‚Äù programme, which consisted of cooking classes for 2.5 hours a week over six weeks.\nAdditionally, as a follow on completion of the Healthy Food made easy programme, I hope to challenge myself by cooking all my college meals myself, as generally I would buy lunch outside.\n\n\nSkills\nüíª Programming Languages:\nTech Stack: Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GitHub and SQL.\nComputer software: Microsoft Office, Git, Alteryx, Tableau, Power BI.\n\n\nFood I baked:\nüç™Below are examples of foods I baked while volunteering and in my free time:\n  \n\n\nFood I cooked:\nüçõBelow are examples of foods I cooked while volunteering and in my free time:\n   \n\n\nMe Rock climbing:\nü™®Below is an example video of me rock climbing and some fun pictures of me in the sport:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
