This project was developed during an 8-week course introducing SQL by Girls Code First. Through this course, I acquired fundamental SQL skills and completed an individual assignment covering various topics, including:

*   SQL coding and database management techniques.
*   Data analysis.
*   Analyzing data from complex structures.
*   Data manipulation with SQL programming language.
*   Data management using SQL coding techniques.
*   Database design and data visualisation.
*   Project presentation.

For my project, I designed a database focused on restaurant order management. This involved implementing foreign and primary keys and creating an Entity-Relationship (EER) diagram.
