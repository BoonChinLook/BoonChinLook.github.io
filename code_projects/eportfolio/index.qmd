This project involves creating a professional ePortfolio using predominately Quarto, Git, and GitHub, hosted on GitHub Pages. It allowed me to showcase my technical expertise, academic accomplishments, and professional growth through various sections like a landing page, CV, and coding-based projects. Through this assignment, I honed my skills in web development, utilizing primarily Quarto, HTML, and SCSS and version control, while demonstrating best practices in multimedia integration, usability, and design. 

 My ePortfolio is now live, deployed on GitHub Pages, representing the culmination of my efforts. Moverover, this repositry can be found by following the link above.
