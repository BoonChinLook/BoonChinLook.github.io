This project involved creating a professional ePortfolio using Quarto, Git, and GitHub, and deploying it through GitHub Pages. The goal was to showcase my technical skills, achievements, and professional development through an organized and interactive platform. Key sections include a landing page, CV, and code-based project highlights.

Throughout this process, I honed my web development skills using Quarto, HTML, and SCSS, while also applying version control best practices with Git. I focused on multimedia integration, usability, and clean design principles to create a user-friendly and visually engaging site. This project enhanced my technical skills and served as a professional platform to present my development over time. It helped me reflect on my growth, from my starting point to my current capabilities and future ambitions.

This live ePortfolio now stands as a reflection of my learning journey and ongoing professional growth.
